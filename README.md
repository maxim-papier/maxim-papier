Born in Karelia, but now live in the mountains of Kazakhstan near Almaty. Also, I lived in Kyiv (UA), Kharkiv (UA), Moscow (RU), Dubna (RU), Lugano (CH), and Tavuglia (IT). 

My roots are in graphic design. Then I worked in branding, followed by UX, then switched to product design and consulting. Somewhere in between, I headed the two design bureaus for a while. Finally, I ended up with my own successful business. 

But ready to pivot again. Now I'm passionate about iOS development. That's why studying at Yandex Practicum since June of 2022. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?

After my study, I would like to develop AR applications.

_In addition, I am fond of time management and productivity and delve into popular neurophysiology. I love many sports, especially tennis, mountain biking, and BJJ. Happy father. Adore parenting._
