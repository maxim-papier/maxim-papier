Born in Karelia (Karjala), I've established roots in various parts of the world, living in locales ranging from the mountains of Kazakhstan near Almaty to cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv, Moscow, Dubna, Lugano, and Tavuglia.

My career began in graphic design and evolved through roles in branding, UX, and product design. I've led two design bureaus and eventually branched out to establish a successful business in a field completely unrelated to design.

In 2022, I embarked on a new journey by enrolling in Yandex Practicum's beta cohort for iOS development. After 13 intense months and 1300 hours of training, I graduated in 2023, a considerable achievement given that I had never programmed before.

I'm currently focused on developing an iOS application as a indie-developer. Beyond the tech world, my interests span time management, productivity, and neurophysiology. In my leisure time, sports like tennis, mountain biking, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu capture my attention. Above all, I am a proud and devoted father.
